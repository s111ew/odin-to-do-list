# To Do List App

As part of [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) curriculum I created a To-Do list webapp with persisting local storage.

I was able to practice using WebPack to roll up the modules and assets for maximum browser compatibility - and also work with the JSON data format for the first time.

A live preview of the website is available [here](https://s111ew.github.io/odin-to-do-list/).

Stack:
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript
• JSON
• npm
• WebPack
• Git
